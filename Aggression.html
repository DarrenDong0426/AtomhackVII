      What are Microaggressions? Microaggressions are small things that 
      people say that people tend to look over or even call it “just a 
      joke”, which brings a negative energy towards the group mentioned 
      in the microaggression(intentional or not). Some examples are:
    </p>
    <p>
        -Calling things “gay” in a deragatory manner
    </p>
    <p>
      -Assuming that someone is smart because they are Asian
    </p>
    <p>
        -Normalizing making someone feel uncomfortable but seeing it as a “joke”
    </p>
      <p>
        -Calling someone autistic or retarted when they actually do not have the disability
      </p>
