      <p> With many Asian Americans being attacked in public places and also facing a current 
        rise in racism towards the Asian community, it is important that we notice and bring awareness 
        to the racism Bronx Science students face. As a community, it is also important that we all 
        listen to each other and uplift one another by listening to others' stories. In this website, 
        you will find quotes and stories of Asian American students and the things they have dealt with 
        in the Bronx Science community. Please take some time and read these experiences to bring support 
        for the Asian American students in Bronx Science. Thank you.
