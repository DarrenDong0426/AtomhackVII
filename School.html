       Here are certain examples of racism towards the Asian community at Bronx Science. 
      This ranges from being underrepresented in class, being left out, and many others.

it in action. Mostly because I think I look relatively intimidating. 
But I can say that As a whole, Anti Asian Sentiments, or really 
racism towards any race often starts and roots itself from 
misconceptions, willful ignorance, or stereotypes of the said race. 
America, despite being the Land of the free, was founded by colonists 
         who basically rejected all that weren't what they believed in. And in 
         modern america, it's still the same thing, people, no matter of what 
         race, refuses to understand the history of a country and/or the 
         struggles that they faced to be here".

 "America, and alot of western media in general that cover eastern 
 news, are biased inherently. They don't put things into context, 
 CNN, the Tonight Show, Fox News, all say things that paint 
 countries that they have cultural differences with in a bad light 
 because they believe that inherently, Democracy or other western 
           standards are better. In america, you don't learn anything about 
           china's struggles in their civil war, you don't learn about 
           Burma/Myanmar, you don't hear anything about Nanking, you only 
           get taught the issues that the west considered big.The East 
           doesn't get this treatment in history class. The east gets 
           glossed over, and you only really ever learn about what they did 
           in context with what they did to support the west"
